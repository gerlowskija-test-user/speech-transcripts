# Speech Transcripts

A data set containing text transcripts of recent speeches and press appearances by politicians.

## Motivation: Why should you use this?
My aim in creating this project is to, in some small way, promote a more content-based, fact-based discourse in the political sphere.

I think providing a single-place where transcripts of recent press-appearances can be found is an important step in that direction.  This already exists to an extent on youTube, where speeches are generally archived in full.  However, video's don't open themselves up to searching/analysis in quite the same way as text does.  So I wanted to create a space where this content can be shared in a textual form.

My hope is that by hosting full-transcripts of speeches and press appearances, I can:

1) Make it easier for common citizens to access first-party sources, and get the information they need to make an informed vote.

2) Make it easier for political commentators to cite sources in their comments/critiques.

3) Provide an unaltered, unbiased data source that others can use for further analysis, or as the basis for other more helpful works.

## Contributing
I'm happy to consider any contributions.  I'm looking to expand the coverage of speeches in this data set, as well as minor corrections to speeches already covered.  I'm currently investigating different ways to do this, but it's likely be a pull-request based system.  This will be updated soon with more instructions.  Please direct any questions/comments to gerlowskija@gmail.com.
